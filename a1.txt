4a. How many distinct keys, keys which each produce different ciphertexts for the same message, do each of the three ciphers have? 
Note: 
1. Only replace the "___" with your answer.
2. Any other change in the template might result in a potential mark deduction.

Original caesar cipher
  Answer: 24 (Number)
  Explanation: Using the 25 letters alphabet we have 24 distinct keys excluding the zero shift. (10-20 words)

Problem 1 implementation
  Answer: 24 (Number)
  Explanation: LETTERS has 25 letters, but one is the zero shift, so only 24 keys give different ciphertexts. (10-20 words)

Problem 2 implementation
  Answer: 24 (Number)
  Explanation: There are 25 shifts, but the zero shift leaves plaintext unchanged, so only 24 distinct ciphertexts exist. (10-20 words)

4b. Is the problem 2 cipher stronger than the original Caesar cipher?
  Answer: Yes (Yes/No)
  Explanation: The key changes based on the previous plaintext, hiding fixed-shift patterns and frequencies  (10-20 words)

4c. Will encrypting the space help address the weaknesses of the Caesar cipher?
  Answer: Yes (Yes/No)
  Explanation: Hiding spaces obscures word boundaries, making guessing common words and patterns significantly harder. (10-20 words)
