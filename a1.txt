4a. How many distinct keys, keys which each produce different ciphertexts for the same message, do each of the three ciphers have? 
Note: 
1. Only replace the "___" with your answer.
2. Any other change in the template might result in a potential mark deduction.

Original caesar cipher
  Answer: 26 (Number)
  Explanation: Key is one of the 26 letters therefore there are 26 possible shifts (10-20 words)

Problem 1 implementation
  Answer: 25 (Number)
  Explanation: LETTERS is missing "J" therefore the ket is one of the 25 letters so we have 25 possible shifts(10-20 words)

Problem 2 implementation
  Answer: 25 (Number)
  Explanation: Since only the initial key is chosen we end up with 25 possibilities (10-20 words)

4b. Is the problem 2 cipher stronger than the original Caesar cipher?
  Answer: Yes (Yes/No)
  Explanation: The key changes based on the previous plaintext, hiding fixed-shift patterns and frequencies  (10-20 words)

4c. Will encrypting the space help address the weaknesses of the Caesar cipher?
  Answer: Yes (Yes/No)
  Explanation: It would hide the word boundaries (10-20 words)
